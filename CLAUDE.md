# Claude Code — Project Instructions

This file is the canonical briefing for any Claude session working on this repo. Read it before touching any file.

## What this project is

A personal PWA for tracking AFL Junior League games for Alek (#13, Hammond Park Hurricanes Blue). It generates Fox Footy-style match reports and season narratives in English (for Alek) and Bulgarian (for his grandparents). Hosted as a static app on GitHub Pages from `/docs`.

**Not a team app. Not a public app.** One player, two audiences, one device per game.

---

## The people

| Person | Role | Language | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zak (dad) | Designer, stat logger, primary user | English | Tracker password |
| Alek | Player, report reader (8 in 2026; `season-config.json` has birth year) | English | Set up by Zak |
| Grandparents | Fans following from Bulgaria | Bulgarian | Family password |

**About Alek:** Plays for Hammond Park Blue (#13). Loves feeling like a real AFL star. The match reports are written so he feels like he's reading about himself in The Age sports section. The stories help him and Zak identify areas of improvement.

**Club details:** Hammond Park Hurricanes · Home ground: Frankland Park · Home colours: green/white · Away: white/green.

---

## Hard constraints — never break these

- **Passwords as hashes, never plaintext.** `scripts/auth.js` stores SHA-256 hashes. Plaintext passwords never enter any file in the repo. To rotate a password, replace the hash. The file documents the one-liner.
- **BG side is view-only.** Bulgarian screens show stats and stories only. No game tracking, no editing, no write operations. The tracker is English-side only (`#/en/tracker`). This is enforced in the router in `scripts/app.js`.
- **Old games are not editable.** Games can only be tracked live. Saved game JSON files are final. There is no edit flow for past games.
- **Do not include the model identifier in commits, PRs, code comments, or any repo artifact.** Keep it to chat replies only.
- **Do not add build steps or bundlers.** The deploy is static: Pages serves `/docs` as-is. No npm build, no webpack, no postinstall magic.

---

## Architecture

### Stack

- Plain ES modules (no bundler, no framework)
- Hash-based SPA router (`#/`, `#/en`, `#/bg`, `#/en/tracker`, `#/bg/story/*`, `#/en/arc`, `#/bg/arc`)
- Service worker for offline shell (cache-first) + data (network-first, fallback to cache)
- GitHub Pages static host; data files are fetched at runtime
- PWA: installable on iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome)

### Design system (glass-morphism)

CSS custom properties on `:root`:
- `--t` — page background (dark charcoal)
- `--glass`, `--glass-strong` — card backgrounds
- `--blur` — backdrop blur amount
- `--hairline`, `--edge-top` — borders and top edge glow
- `--lift`, `--lift-sm`, `--press` — box-shadow tokens
- `--text-hi`, `--text-mid`, `--text-lo` — text hierarchy
- `--green-accent` — the one accent colour (AFL green). Used for HP scores, positive stats, position button active state.

### Icon system

All icons are inline SVG via `icon(name, cls)` in `scripts/icons.js`. Returns `<svg class="icn ${cls}">`. Thin-line style. Never use emoji or font icons.

### Routing and screens

| Route | Module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `#/` | `app.js` | Two-flag landing page |
| `#/en` | `fixtures.js` | EN Fixtures & Results |
| `#/bg` | `fixtures.js` | BG Fixtures (fan/grandparent tone) |
| `#/en/tracker` | `tracker.js` | Live game tracker (EN, password-gated) |
| `#/bg/story/prologue` | `story.js` | BG season prologue |
| `#/bg/story/{N}` | `story.js` | BG season chapter N |
| `#/en/reports` | `story.js` | EN match reports list |
| `#/en/report/{date}` | `story.js` | EN match report reader |
| `#/bg/reports` | `story.js` | BG match reports list |
| `#/bg/report/{date}` | `story.js` | BG match report reader |
| `#/en/arc` | `story.js` | EN season summary (stats + arc) |
| `#/bg/arc` | `story.js` | BG season arc (stats + warm narrative) |

### Menu

`scripts/menu.js` provides `menuButtonHtml(lang, currentKey, extras=[])` and `attachMenu(lang, onAction)`. The `extras` array is `[{action, ic, label}]` objects that render as `data-action` buttons. The click handler dispatches `onAction(action)` for extras before checking for `href`.

---

## Data schemas

### season-config.json

```json
{
  "player": { "name": "Alek", "number": 13, "nicknames": ["Aleko", "Alek"] },
  "teamName": "Hammond Park Hurricanes",
  "seasonTeamName": null,
  "shoeColour": "white",
  "colours": { "primary": "#006633", "secondary": "#FFFFFF" }
}
```

### fixtures.json

```json
{
  "rounds": [
    {
      "round": 1, "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "time": "HH:MM",
      "ground": "...", "isHome": true,
      "result": null, "score": null, "opponentScore": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Results in `fixtures.json` are placeholders — they are overridden at runtime by `games/index.json` + `game-YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

### games/game-YYYY-MM-DD.json

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "round": 1,
  "isHome": true,
  "ground": "...",
  "quarterDuration": 900,
  "quarters": [
    {
      "quarter": 1,
      "position": "mid",
      "mood": "🔥",
      "notes": "...",
      "aleksStats": { "goals": 0, "behinds": 0, "shots": 0, "marks": 0, "markAttempts": 0, "disposals": 0, "disposalAttempts": 0, "tackles": 0, "tackleAttempts": 0 },
      "teamScore": { "hp": { "goals": 0, "behinds": 0 }, "opp": { "goals": 0, "behinds": 0 } }
    }
  ],
  "totals": {
    "aleksStats": { "goals": 0, "behinds": 0, "shots": 0, "marks": 0, "markAttempts": 0, "disposals": 0, "disposalAttempts": 0, "tackles": 0, "tackleAttempts": 0 },
    "teamScore": { "hp": { "goals": 0, "behinds": 0 }, "opp": { "goals": 0, "behinds": 0 } }
  },
  "debrief": { "didWell": "...", "workOn": "..." },
  "events": [
    { "quarter": 1, "time": 142, "action": "goal", "position": "fwd", "team": "hp", "scorer": "alek", "points": 6 },
    { "quarter": 1, "time": 55, "action": "position", "from": "mid", "to": "fwd" },
    { "quarter": 1, "time": 300, "action": "mark", "position": "fwd", "ok": true },
    { "quarter": 1, "time": 300, "action": "disposal", "position": "fwd", "ok": false },
    { "quarter": 1, "time": 300, "action": "tackle", "position": "fwd", "ok": true }
  ]
}
```

**Events stream notes:**
- `time` is seconds elapsed from the start of that quarter (0 = quarter start, `quarterDuration` = quarter end)
- For scoring actions: `team` is `"hp"` or `"opp"`, `scorer` is `"alek"` or `"teammate"`, `points` is 6 (goal) or 1 (behind)
- For position actions: `from` and `to` are position keys (`"def"`, `"mid"`, `"fwd"`, `null` = bench/unset); no `position` field
- For stat actions: `ok` is `true` for successful, `false` for attempt; `position` is current position
- Historical games (rounds 1–9, 2026) predate the events stream and have `events: []`. The timeline graph and by-position breakdown only render when events are present.

## Tracker architecture

`scripts/tracker.js` is the live-game tracking module. Key internals:

### State object `G`

```js
{
  quarter: 1,
  timerRemaining: 900,
  timerRunning: false,
  quarterDuration: 900,
  current: { position: null },
  log: [],     // undo stack
  events: [],  // events stream (written to exported JSON)
  quarters: [] // per-quarter snapshots
}
```

### Position cycling (debounced)

Position changes are debounced with a 1.1s settle timer. Module-level globals:
- `_posTimer` — the pending settle timeout
- `_posStart` — `{from, q, t}` captured at the first tap of a burst (the moment the sub actually happened)
- `_posDisplay` — the position shown on the button during cycling

`cyclePosition()` advances `_posDisplay` and resets the timer. `commitPosition()` fires after the timer settles: records one `{type:'position', from, to}` log entry and one `{action:'position', from, to, quarter, time}` event. Round-trips (end up back at `from`) record nothing.

`flushPosition()` is called before every `logAction()` so that if a stat is recorded while a cycle is settling, the position change commits first with the right timestamp.

`cancelPositionCycle()` is called by undo when `_posTimer !== null` — aborts the cycle and restores the displayed label.

### Log vs events

- `G.log` is the **undo stack** — internal format, used for undo only
- `G.events` is the **events stream** — exported in JSON, used for match reports

They grow in parallel. `undoLast()` pops from `G.log` and mirrors the reversal in `G.events`.

### Scoreboard layout

```
[ Q1 chip (left) | clock (centre) | ▶ run button (right) ]
[ HP score  :  Opp score ]
```

HP score is always on the left. Team names below scores, HP name in green.

### Menu extras

Tracker registers `TRACKER_MENU_EXTRAS = [{action:'newgame', ic:'play', label:'New Game'}]`. The New Game action confirms if a game is in progress, then clears localStorage and re-renders.

---

## Match reports (`scripts/story.js`)

### Report body order

1. Stats summary (totals)
2. Score timeline (SVG worm — only renders when `game.events` has scoring entries)
3. By-position breakdown (only renders when `game.events` has position-change entries)
4. Broadcast Analysis (coach notes)
5. Headline
6. The Play-by-Play (commentator narrative)

### Timeline graph

SVG score margin worm. HP above the midline (green fill, 22% opacity), opposition below (red fill, 20% opacity). Dashed quarter separators. Legend with lead text. Uses `<clipPath>` to split the area fill by sign.

### By-position breakdown

Aggregates events stream by `e.position`. Rows: position label / points / stat counts (G/B/S + M/D/T). Only the positions Alek actually played appear.

### Position labels

```js
const POS_FULL = {
  def: { en: 'Defence',  bg: 'Защита' },
  mid: { en: 'Midfield', bg: 'Полузащита' },
  fwd: { en: 'Forward',  bg: 'Нападение' },
  none: { en: 'Unset / bench', bg: 'Без позиция' }
};
```

## Story generation (Claude's role)

Claude does not handle data storage or calculations — it writes stories only. Stories are generated once, saved to file, and never regenerated unless explicitly requested.

### Story structure per game

**English:**
- `headline` — punchy match headline
- `commentator` — Fox Footy broadcast style. Energetic, specific, AFL broadcast voice. Alek loves feeling like a real AFL star.
- `coach` — warm and constructive. Acknowledges what went well, identifies one or two areas to work on. Uses `debrief.didWell` and `debrief.workOn` as primary input.

**Bulgarian:**
- Same three fields, translated and adapted in tone
- Grandparent audience — warm, proud, descriptive. 2–3 rich paragraphs that help someone who wasn't there imagine the game and feel close to Alek.

### Storytelling guardrails

- Stories should feel fresh and specific to this game, never templated
- Reference specific stats as evidence, not as a list
- Vary the structure and opening each week
- Reference position (def/mid/fwd) to contextualise stats
- Reference quarter mood where it adds colour
- Coach notes: constructive and encouraging — never harsh for a child of Alek's age

### Input Claude receives when generating a story

Structured JSON containing: game metadata, quarter-by-quarter stats and positions, totals, mood per quarter, quarter notes, post-game debrief (`didWell`, `workOn`), and optional season context for richer storytelling.

### Season arc

When writing a season arc, Claude receives all game JSON files and produces a narrative of Alek's development: key moments, milestones, stat trends, in the commentator/coach dual-voice structure.

---

## Service worker

`docs/sw.js` caches the app shell (cache-first) and data files (network-first, fallback).

**Cache names:**
- Shell: `afl-shell-v34` — bump the version number (v35, v36, …) whenever any shell asset changes
- Data: `afl-data-v1` — bump only if the data fetch strategy changes

**When to bump the shell cache:** any change to HTML, CSS, JS, or icon files. The SW activate event deletes old caches automatically, so bumping ensures users get the new files.

---

## Development workflow

### Branch

The active development branch is `claude/afl-junior-league-ui-0m2avd`. Push there; Zak merges to `main` for Pages deploy. After pushing, always create a Pull Request.

### Recording a game (end to end)

The full pipeline is documented in **`GAME-WORKFLOW.md`** at the repo root —
read it when a game JSON is pasted in. In short:

1. Zak tracks the game in the tracker; taps **Copy JSON** at the summary screen.
2. Zak pastes the JSON into Claude Code.
3. Claude Code reads `GAME-WORKFLOW.md` and produces all four outputs: the game
   file + `games/index.json`, the per-game match report (EN + BG) +
   `stories/index.json`, a new BG season chapter in `stories/YYYY.json`, and a
   refreshed season arc in `stories/season-YYYY.json`.
4. Claude Code pushes to the dev branch and opens a PR; Zak confirms it.

Story craft detail (length, tone, guardrails) lives in
`docs/data/stories/GENERATION.md`.

### File serving

The PWA is static. Use a local server for dev (not `file://` — service workers require HTTP):

```bash
cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

### Adding a new season

1. Copy `docs/data/fixtures.json` schema → `docs/data/fixtures-YYYY.json`
2. Add `docs/data/stories/YYYY.json` (season narrative bundle for BG)
3. The year bar and BG story picker discover the new season automatically when the year file exists.

## Current project status (as of June 2026)

All 7 planned phases are complete, plus a tracker overhaul and a UI polish pass. The 2026 season (rounds 1–9) is fully documented with game JSON, match reports, and a season arc. The app is live on GitHub Pages.

### Phases complete

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation: PWA shell, router, two-flag landing |
| 2 | Fixtures & Stories: EN/BG fixtures, season picker, BG story reader |
| 3 | Stat Tracker: live game tracking, per-quarter state, export |
| 4 | Password Gates: SHA-256 hashes, session unlock, EN+BG sides |
| 5 | Game Data Pipeline: results driven by game files, config.js |
| 6 | Match Reports: score timeline graph, by-position breakdown, EN+BG report reader |
| 7 | Season Arc: aggregated season stats, EN+BG arc narrative |

### Tracker overhaul (post-Phase 7)

- Timer moved into scoreboard top row (Q chip | clock | run button)
- Team names prominent below scores; HP name in green
- New Game action in the tracker menu
- Undo button correctly disabled when log is empty or a position cycle is settling
- Debounced position cycling: only the final settled position is logged, with a timestamp stamped at the first tap
- Events stream in exported JSON: per-action timestamps with quarter, time-in-quarter, position

### UI polish pass (June 2026)

- Rebranded from "AFL Kids Tracker" to "AFL Junior League" across all files
- Landing page fits one screen with no scroll
- Fixtures: story headline used as card title for recorded games; "HP Blue" → "Hammond Park Blue" in green; no truncation on long team names; improved past-game contrast
- Match reports: sections renamed ("Broadcast Analysis", "The Play-by-Play"); more separation before headline
- Tracker duration presets: 15/20/25/30 min; run button is green/yellow/red by state; 1-minute warning vibration + clock pulse; pre-game edit opponent + swap home/away buttons; Alek stats in column layout; scores and team names 50% larger; live lead margin chip in scoreboard
- BG fixtures: "КР" → "КРЪГ"
